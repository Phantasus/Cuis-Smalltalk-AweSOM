# AweSOM - The Simple Object Machine Smalltalk implemented in Smalltalk

## Introduction

[SOM] is a minimal Smalltalk dialect used to teach VM construction at the [Hasso
Plattner Institute][HPI]. It was originally built at the University of Ã…rhus
(Denmark) where it was used for teaching and as the foundation for [Resilient
Smalltalk][RS].

This repository contains the Smalltalk-based implementation of SOM, including
SOM's standard library and a number of examples. In addition to AweSOM, other
implementations exist for Java (SOM), C (CSOM), C++ (SOM++), and Python
(PySOM). Please see the [main project page][SOM] for links to other VM
implementations.

A simple Hello World looks like:

```Smalltalk
Hello = (
  run = (
    'Hello World!' println.
  )
)
```

This particular repository represents a fork of [AweSOM][AweSOM], which
was ported to [Cuis Smalltalk][Cuis].

## Setup

Install the core-lib submodule, which downloads the core library
of SOM, written in SOM. Which in turn is used by the Cuis implementation
inside the image for core libraries and testcases.

```Bash
git submodule update --init
```

Then install the packages contained in the repository in an image
and place the resulting image into the repository directory. This
needs to be done, so that the testcases and any SOM code can see
the core-lib.

For installing the packages do:

```Smalltalk
Feature require: 'AweSOM-Meta'.
Feature require: 'AweSOM-Test'.
Feature require: 'AweSOM-Compiler'.
Feature require: 'AweSOM-CoreObjects'.
Feature require: 'AweSOM-Interpreter'.
Feature require: 'AweSOM-VM'.
```
