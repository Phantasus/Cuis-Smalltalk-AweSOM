AweSOM was started as a student project at the [Hasso Plattner Institute][HPI].
Its original creators are Arvid Heise, Matthias Kleine, and Robert Krahn. The
project supervisor was Michael Haupt.

Later on, Stefan Marr experimented with it in his PhD and maintained it
irregularly.

Years later at around 10. April 2020 Josef Philip Bernhart cloned
the publicly hosted git repository (on github) and started from this git
commit:
